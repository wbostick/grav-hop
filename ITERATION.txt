Iteration I made off of the feedback I got:
- changed the gravity switching to be more intuitive
  - was previously changing only when you land and hitting your head would not stick you to the surface
  - now changes gravity on collision with surface
- added hazards to give some consequence to actions
- attempted to make tutorial levels more intuitive
